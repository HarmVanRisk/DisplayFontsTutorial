###### Mac app tutorial to display Text in the systems available font families

[How the tutorial ends up looking](./FontViewer/fontsTutorial.png)

The reason behind me creating this is I wanted to learn more about building mac apps so I can improve on my iOS development knowledge.
This project follows the Appcoda tutorial [Getting Started with macOS Programming](https://www.appcoda.com/macos-programming/) where we create a very basic app that just displays the available font families on the mac.
Topics covered:
- Configuring windows (size, position, title, etc.)
- Adding and updating graphical controls
- load, present and close a window programmatically
